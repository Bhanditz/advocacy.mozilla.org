product_1_blurb=For when your air isn’t quite good enough, there’s this air purifier/heater/cooler from Dyson. It’s not just air purification, it’s “Intelligent Air Purification” according to the maker. That means it comes with an app that lets you monitor your air quality and react accordingly. It’s 2017 and “scheduled purification” is now a thing.

product_2_title=Ring Doorbell 2
product_2_blurb=Door knockers are cool, but so old-fashioned. Door bells are neat, but so analog. Welcome to the future. Calling this a doorbell is a bit misleading. It’s a door video, two-way audio, motion sensor, infrared night vision gizmo that lets you see, hear, and speak to people at your door from your phone or computer. But is it creepy? You decide.

product_3_title=Sengled Snap
product_3_blurb=Look up. It’s a light bulb. It’s a video camera. It’s… both? Yes, there is a Wi-Fi enabled, motion detecting, night vision, weatherproof light bulb with a built-in HD video camera. Controlled by an app, it sees all, live streams it to your phone, and stores it in the cloud. No word yet on how many people it takes to screw it in.

product_4_title=August Smart Door Lock
product_4_blurb=Sometime soon, that “Oh crap!” feeling of getting locked out of your house will be as foreign to kids as rotary phones are now thanks to the “smart lock.” Install it on a deadbolt and you can lock and unlock your door with your phone, give people keyless access to your home, and even track who is coming and going while you are away. Apparently it still works with old school keys, for that “Oh crap!” moment when you lose your phone.

product_5_title=Eero
product_5_blurb=Mesh used to mean those hair nets people wore in your elementary school cafeteria. These days, mesh is all the rage when it comes to Wi-Fi technology to cover your entire home, from your backyard to your basement bathroom. This Wi-Fi router system says it uses TrueMesh™ technology, which sure sounds fancy. They do nail their slogan: “Happy Wi-Fi, happy life.”

product_6_title=Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Hub
product_6_blurb=Garage doors refuse to be left out of the Internet of Things revolution. Good for them! This attachment for most garage doors made circa 1993 lets you open and close them with your smartphone — from anywhere. So the next time you go on vacation and wonder, “Huh?, did I close the garage door?”, this gadget has you, and your garage, covered.

product_7_title=iDevices Switch
product_7_blurb=Remember the clapper? That wonderful device from last century that turned your lights on and off with clap of your hands. It’s almost 2018 and the clapper is all grown up into a “connected smart plug.” Plug the outlet into your wall and you can control it with your voice, set up custom on/off schedules on a phone app from anywhere, even monitor your energy use. All that’s missing is the catchy jingle — Clap on, clap off…

product_8_title=Aumi Smart Nightlight
product_8_blurb=This little nightlight of mine, I’m gonna let it shine… just as soon as I pull out my phone and use the app to turn it on. That’s the tune you’ll be singing with this bluetooth enabled, motion activated nightlight. It even lets you chose from 16 millon different color options to find just the right color to keep those scary nighttime monsters at bay.

product_9_title=Parrot Pot
product_9_blurb=Meet the smart flowerpot. Yup, a smart flowerpot. Because even people with green thumbs need to go on vacation. It comes with a self-watering system and built-in sensors the company says monitor things like fertilizer, moisture, light, and temperature levels. The robots really are going to replace us all.

product_10_title=Tile Mate
product_10_blurb=This little nub keeps track of anything: your keys, bags, other people’s bags. But it works in the Bluetooth range, so on its face, this is a super handy gadget. It’s small enough to fit in grandma’s case where she keeps her reading glasses, so in theory she will never wonder where she left them ever again! Only where did she leave her phone, and where’s the button to turn my tooth blue?

product_11_title=Amazon Echo/Show
product_11_blurb=This additional accessory gives visual output to your disembodied Echo’s voice. Now Echo can show you things while it talks to you. (Wait, isn’t that mostly a “tablet”?) Anyway, Show shows the lyrics to the song you are hearing, to-do lists, weather forecasts. (Again, “tablet”?) Show can also hear you from any direction even with loud music playing, using 8 microphones and “beam-forming technology.” And it’s “always getting smarter.” (There it is.)

product_12_title=B&O PLAY Beoplay M5
product_12_blurb=This a beautiful wireless speaker. I want mine in that classy bronze fabric option. And the “well-balanced Bang & Olufsen Signature Sound” sounds fancy to me. It has “three evenly distributed tweeters, a front facing mid-range driver and a powerful woofer that fires its energy down towards (“fires” what now?) a carefully designed disperser, providing a uniform dispersion of well-balanced…” Wait. Is this a $600 <b>Wi-Fi</b> speaker?

product_13_title=Nanoleaf Aurora
product_13_blurb=You’re a rocks star! Why not light up your bedroom like a one? Now you can with this “smart lighting prodcuct.” Hang these Wi-Fi connected triangular light panels together in whatever designs you dream up. Then download the app and customize the light’s movement, color, and schedule. If you want to add a little more bowchickawowow to your room, get the module that let’s the lights beat in rhythm to your music. You are a rock star after all.

product_16_title=Sonos Play:1
product_16_blurb=This speaker is Wi-Fi, not Bluetooth, so that bumps it up in our book, because that means a phone call won’t stop the jams, which is pretty perfect, because if it’s actually someone who is actually making a phone call and they actually expect you to just cold-call stop what you are doing and answer, you are going to need music as some kind of anchor to all that is decent and right in this world. Also, “surprisingly rich” sound.

product_18_title=Nest Thermostat
product_18_blurb=This thermostat is ENERGY STAR certified, and that’s apparently a first, which seems pretty awesome. No cameras or mics, though it has a sensor that detects your proximity, okay. And “it learns what temperature you like and builds a schedule around yours. Since 2011, the Nest Thermostat has saved billions of kWh of energy in millions of homes worldwide.” They have a counter on their website that shows how many $billions. This is a major way to save $100 or more every year, and help reduce energy consumption to boot.

product_22_title=Meural Canvas
product_22_blurb=Ever buy a painting, hang it up, then get bored with it after a while? Yeah, me neither. For some people though, that happens. And for those people, there’s this digital art canvas. It’s a fancy Wi-Fi connected art frame with a built-in HD screen that changes art with a swipe of your hand. Upload your own artwork or download some from thousands of artists, who make 60% of what Meural earns on their art. Neat.

product_24_title=Hiku
product_24_blurb=In any home, few things are more important than the humble grocery list. Now there’s a “smart shopping button” for when pen and paper feel so out-dated. Speak your deepest grocery store desires to it and they automatically appear in a shared shopping list app on your phone. It also scans barcodes and connects to online grocery stores. The most useful feature might be the ability to organize your list to match the way you walk the aisles in your grocery store. Now that’s progress!

product_25_title=Google Home
product_25_blurb=“Help Is Here,” they say on their website, and it’s hard to imagine anyone wouldn’t be charmed and helped by the minimalist, effortless dreams of beauty and function embodied by Google Home. It is the brain and right hand enabler of your connected life, and anyone searching to outsource those constant barrages of adverting thoughts will likely welcome this aneasthetic.

product_26_title=Flic
product_26_blurb=Ever wanted a handy button on your desk you could push and have, say, a butler bring you a Diet Coke? This product is a little like that. It’s a little silicone button — about the size of a peppermint patty — and it pairs up with all sorts of apps on your phone. Set it up and then push the button to call an Uber, order a pizza, play music, even let your family know you’ve fallen and you can’t get up.

product_35_title=Smart Letters
product_35_blurb=Kids love screens. Parents hate the guilt of letting their kids have too much screen time. Here’s a compromise.
